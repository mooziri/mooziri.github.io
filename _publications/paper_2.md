Background: Cognitive impairments are linked to poor treatment response and disease control in allergic asthma. However, there are no studies exploring attention-related functional brain alterations in allergic asthma. Here, we explore attention deficit and its association with clinical characteristics and common neuropsychiatric disorders in patients with allergic asthma.
Methods: We recruited 38 participants, equally distributed into healthy and asthma groups. Behavioral, neurophysiological, and lung function assessment tools were used in this study.
Results: Our behavioral data show that allergic asthma induces attention impairment. Additionally, the event-related potentials (ERP) analysis reveals that this attention deficit is associated with a disruption in cognitive processing capability in frontal brain areas. These behavioral and neurophysiological abnormalities were strongly correlated with disease severity and neuropsychiatric comorbidities of asthmatic patients.
Conclusion: Together, here we propose that disrupted neurophysiological responses in frontal brain areas might lead to attention impairments in patients with allergic asthma. These findings could help characterizing the neuro-pathophysiology of cognitive disorders in allergic asthma, possibly opening the way for development of novel treatment strategies.
