Anxiety is among the most fundamental mammalian behaviors. Despite the physiological and pathological importance, its underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we recorded the activity of olfactory bulb (OB) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats, which are critical structures to brainâ€™s emotional processing network, while exploring different anxiogenic environments. Our results show that presence in anxiogenic contexts increases the OB and mPFC regional theta activities. Also, these local activity changes are associated with enhanced OB-mPFC theta power- and phase-based functional connectivity as well as OB-to-mPFC information transfer. Interestingly, these effects are more prominent in the unsafe zones of the anxiogenic environments, compared to safer zones. This consistent trend of changes in diverse behavioral environments as well as local and long-range neural activity features suggest that the dynamics of OB-mPFC circuit theta oscillations might underlie different types of anxiety behaviors, with possible implications for anxiety disorders.
